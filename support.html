    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>Dealt features Baker's Game, a challenging solitaire variant similar to FreeCell. The key difference: you must build tableau stacks by <strong>same suit</strong> (not alternating colors).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Move all 52 cards to the four foundation piles, building up by suit from Ace to King</li>
        <li><strong>Tableau:</strong> Build down by same suit (e.g., 7♠ on 8♠)</li>
        <li><strong>Free Cells:</strong> Use the 4 free cells to temporarily hold cards</li>
        <li><strong>Tap:</strong> Auto-move a card to the best available spot</li>
        <li><strong>Drag:</strong> Move cards to a specific destination</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What is a Game ID?</h3>
    <p>Each deal has a unique Game ID (seed number). The same Game ID always produces the same card arrangement, so you can replay specific deals or share them with friends.</p>

    <h3>What does the checkmark mean?</h3>
    <p>A green checkmark next to the Game ID means someone in the world has already solved that deal. You can see the global best time and fewest moves.</p>

    <h3>How do I play a solvable game?</h3>
    <p>Tap "New Game" and select "Load Solved Game" to get a deal that's been solved before. You can also enable "Only Winnable Deals" in Settings.</p>

    <h3>Does my progress sync across devices?</h3>
    <p>Yes, if you're signed into Game Center, your statistics sync automatically across all your devices.</p>

    <h3>How do I report a bug?</h3>
    <p>Go to Settings → Report a Bug and describe the issue. You can also email us directly.</p>
